  "story": "Many years ago, this part of the Realm of Man was ruled by a magic-user named Gygar, a man of great and mysterious powers. He ruled the lands from his mighty castle Mistamere, located at the foot of the mountains to the north. Gygar died after a long and peaceful rule, but no successor was named. Over the years, the unclaimed castle fell into ruins. Now, centuries later, the outline of the broken towers can still be seen from the town, ever beckoning to seekers of danger, fame and fortune.",
  "opening_prompt": "You have gathered around a dinner table in the Gold Dragon Inn, in the center of town, to discuss your plans. The Inn is busy, filled with ruddy-faced townsfolk and other adventurers, who are eating, drinking, laughing, and having a splendid time.\n\nYou have all heard the tales told by others, tales of monsters lurking within the ruins and guarding rich treasures. None of you have been there, but after an evening of discussion, you decide to try your luck in the castle ruin, and plan to meet at dawn for the short journey.\n\nOne special note: the town rulers have offered a reward of 1,000 gp for the capture of Bargle, the renegade magic-user! The death of Aleena, a well-known cleric, was the 'last straw.' They want to stop this danger once and for all, so keep your eyes open!\n\nIt's morning, and you're off to the castle. It lies only 3 miles from town, just a healthy walk past a local farmer's fields. As you follow the dirt road past the farm, you greet the workers tending the crops. It's a lovely summer's day, and all seems peaceful. The land owner himself sits atop a wagon, watching his men, and chats with you before you continue onward.\n\nAfter bidding him a good day, you continue toward the ruin. As you approach, you see that the walls are jagged and full of small holes, and a few large stone blocks have tumbled to the earth, laying scattered around the ruins. A gateway in the center of the front wall stands empty, and the massive outer doors now lay rotting nearby. This gateway seems to be the easiest entrance through the wall. A 10' wide gaping hole is in the wall off to your left, and could be another entrance. You do not see any other entrances; the rest of the wall is crumbling, but few wide holes have opened. This outer area has no other interesting features. A sheer cliff, the face of a mountain, rises at the north edge of the ruins.",

He wears dark leather garb—not armor—that allows him to move silently. His black hair is tied back in a practical knot, and a faint scar runs along his left jawline from a trap that nearly killed him years ago. Ragnar carries a shortbow slung across his back and fights two-handed with a dagger in his left and a shortsword in his right, moving with the fluid grace of an experienced rogue. He speaks in a low, measured voice and has a habit of testing doors and floors before crossing. His keen eyes miss nothing—every shadow, every loose stone, every telltale wire. Despite his cautious nature, he's fiercely loyal to those who've earned his trust.",

A silver holy symbol hangs from a leather cord around her neck, glinting when she invokes her deity's power. Eilonwy is more of a spellcaster than a melee combatant—her true strength lies in healing wounds and turning undead with divine authority. She speaks with gentle conviction, offering words of encouragement to her companions, but her voice becomes commanding and fearless when confronting the forces of darkness. She carries a small pouch of healing herbs at her belt and keeps a prayer book tucked in her pack.
