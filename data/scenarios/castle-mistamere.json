Last night at the Gold Dragon Inn you listened, wide‑eyed, while scarred men traded rumors of Castle Mistamere, Gygar’s fallen keep, now haunted by vermin, shades, and a renegade mage called Bargle.\n\nThey spoke of farmsteads bled by tithe‑men sworn to no lord, of caravans that vanish on the north road, and of a purse of coin promised for any proof that Bargle is cast out or dead. A few hard truths stuck--kobolds skulk the outer yard; a locked postern clings to the old gate; and something slimy dozes in a trench near the wall. Light, noise, and patience matter more than a hot blade.\n\nDawn finds you at the shattered approach. Stone teeth gnaw the sky; vines choke the gatehouse like strangler’s fingers. Your lantern sputters to life. You own little beyond your steel, your wits, and the stubborn courage that dragged you here.\n\nAhead lies the sagging gate and its watchful yard. To one side, you see a rubble‑choked breach yawning black. Behind you, the road curls back toward the inn and its honest fire. And that trench must be somewhere nearby...",
