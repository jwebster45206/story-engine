  "story": "An infamous renegade mage—Bargle—has turned the ruined halls of Castle Mistamere into a nest of schemes. The player approaches the shattered towers, seeking gold, glory, and justice. Delving from wind-scoured ruins into lightless vaults, the player must outwit cunning kobolds, resist insidious songs, and breach arcane seals before finally confronting Bargle himself.",

  "opening_prompt": "You are a human fighter on your very first adventure—broke as a church mouse, but stubborn as an ox. Last night at the Gold Dragon Inn you listened, wide-eyed, as old hands muttered about Castle Mistamere: a ruined keep once held by the wizard Gygar, its halls now haunted by vermin, restless dead… and a renegade mage named Bargle.\n\nThey spoke of farmsteads bled by tithe collectors who answer to no lord, of caravans that vanish on the north road, and of a bounty quietly posted for anyone who can drive Bargle out—or prove he’s gone for good. A few practical tips stuck: kobolds skulk the outer yard; there’s a locked postern by the old gate; and something slimy lairs in a trench near the wall. Light, noise, and patience matter more than brute steel.\n\nDawn finds you at the shattered approach. Wind hisses through teeth of broken stone; vines choke the fallen gatehouse. Your lantern sputters to life in your shaking hand. You own little beyond your blade, your wits, and the courage that brought you here.\n\nAhead: the sagging gate and a watchful yard. To one side: a rubble-choked breach with a view into darkness. Somewhere nearby: that trench the teamsters warned you about. Behind you, the road curls back toward the inn and a warm hearth.\n\nWhat do you do?",
