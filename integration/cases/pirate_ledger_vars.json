Gibbs nods respectfully as you board. The ship shows signs of wear from your recent voyages - loose rigging, weathered wood, and minor damage that will need attention before your next adventure. On deck, you notice the ship repair ledger lying near the mast, and Billy the Parrot squawks a greeting from his perch."
