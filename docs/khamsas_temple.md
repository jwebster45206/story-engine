# Khamsa's Temple

An Egyptian-style temple, cursed by Set and sunken over hundreds of years into the desert. 

## Level One

The inexorable passabe of time has not obscured the lavishness of Khamsa's sanctuary. Though characterized by signs of abandonment, the inner structure has been as resilient as the exterior during its 4000-year existence.

This was once the upper level of Khamsa's temple, but sand has largely buried the structure in the desert. 

### Entryway

A pair of matched, semicircular projections stand carved into the Valley of Kings, each 50’ high and pierced by long, thin windows. Between them lies the entrance to the temple. Sand cascades into the chamber through the base of these windows, spilling into the foyer like a waterfall. The enormous room is nearly 80’ above the base of the temple at its lowest level, the accumulated sediment of centuries of windstorms.

West -> Exit to desert

### Foyer

The foyer is large open space, dominated by a large chasm. The shadowy reaches of the far walls can be revealed by torches. If the PCs have light other than torches, a massive stone head can be seen high against the opposite wall of the chamber, partially covered by sand. Most features of the grim countenance are worn away, but the figure still reflects great power, and the enormous statue is an awe-inspiring creation, indicative of the advancement of the culture that created it.

The “floorless” chamber extends over 60’ to the eastern wall. Any PC unwise enough to jump blindly into the temple will perish. 

Near the southern end of the opposite Eastern wall, a large, rubble-strewn fissure allows access to the inner temple. PCs must use rope, magic, or other narrative means to cross the chasm.

### Gallery

This long hall is lined with tall columns covered with dozens of slithering, jet-black snakes. These creatures appear to regard the PCs with interest, but they are harmless and will not attack the party. If approached, they glide away along the marble floor, fleeing before the group. The enormous chamber ends in a set of heavy bronze doors on the East, which are closed but not barred, leading to the Receiving Room. A smaller set of side doors also lie to the north.

East -> Receiving Room
North -> Trophy Room

### Receiving Room

This chamber, once used by Khamsa to greet important worshipers and other dignitaries, is dominated by an obsidian platform upon which rests a heavy wooden chair, richly in design and decoration. A broken door at the base of the dais leads out of the chamber.

A secret door in the northern wall opens to reveal a narrow passageway that extends into the chamber where Khamsa once kept his concubines (area 6).

This room, if examined closely, reveals the footprints of desert creatures and robbers. The most successful invaders of Khamsa’s temple actually reached this chamber before being slain.

East -> Gallery
Secret Door in North Wall -> Corridor

### Corridor

This 10’-wide hallway is filled with dust, cobwebs, and crumbled rock, appearing to have been unused for many years. The fading but still traceable paintings of Khamsa’s great achievements, portrayed in their bloodthirsty fashion. While the specifics of most of these scenes are not discernible, a common theme seems to be powerful beings of varied types paying homage to Khamsa’s greatness.

When entering from the receiving room, a visitor will encounter the following openings from the corridor in the following order:

After 60’, the hallway bends to the west, where a secret door on the south side allows access to the chamber where Khamsa’s concubines once resided. This door can be opened by pressing a slightly raised projection in the headdress of a female figure depicted on the southern wall.

Secret Door -> Harem

Continuing down the passage, a southern open entryway leads to the Chapel. 

Open Entryway -> Chapel

Next, on the south, a set of unlocked double-doors leading south to the Archive room.

Double Doorway -> Archives

Just past the archive doorway,  the corridor bends South, to a finely crafted stairway that descends to the second floor Balconies. 

Levels 1-2 Stairway -> Balconies

### Harem

The only subjects permitted to live within the temple were Khamsa’s concubines, who were housed in this hidden room and guarded by snakes. In the center of the chamber, circular pit, the lower portion of which was once used as a large bath area.

The circular conversation pit and the floor of the room is teeming with Set’s messengers—hundreds of snakes that have survived the centuries on human cannibalism. The scent of human prey drives them to immediate attack. 

Secret Door -> Corridor (at harem point)

### Chapel

This was the most heavily used chamber in the temple complex before the cataclysm, and was the first to be completed. Continuous prayers to Khamsa were once uttered here by his priests. The chamber also held an altar and wall beneath, but it was destroyed by the mad deity that lives in area 13.

The chapel is now occupied by several sons of Kyuss, loathsome creatures that were once clerics in Khamsa’s service. Rising in the ranks through deception and fawning rather than true religious devotion, they appeared to be sanctified men when the cataclysm occurred, and were trapped with their undead status intact. Each occupies one of the alcoves in the northern part of the chapel and will not be surprised.

The son of Kyuss in the northern alcove remains motionless until the PCs enter the room, and then attacks from behind. This attack triggers the two in the southern alcoves to charge the group for melee.

Sons of Kyuss (3): INT low; AL CE; AC 10; MV 9; HD 4; hp 26, 22, 17; THAC0 17; #AT 1; Dmg 1-8; SA fear, disease, worms; SD regeneration; SZ M; ML special; XP 1,400; MC6 (Kyuss, Son of).

Sons of Kyuss are truly dreadful creatures, capable of defeating even the most experienced adventurers. Each son radiates a spherical, 30’ diameter cone of fear that causes all those who fail saving throws vs. spells to flee for a full turn. 60% likely to drop the fear aura when saving throws vs. double-handed attacks are 25% likely to cause a disease that is fatal within 1–6 months unless the victim receives a cure disease spell.

Even more horrid than these physical features are the worms infesting each corpse. One worm per round emerges from the head of each corpse. One worm reaching an exposed limb on a PC must be destroyed before it burrows into the skin of the victim, and the only means to stop it is to burn it away!

The victim’s brain is reached by the worm in 1-4 rounds, at which point the victim is dead and becomes a son of Kyuss. While below the skin, these worms can be slain by cure disease, neutralize poison, or dispel evil spells cast within 1-6 turns. Worms not killed in this time period turn the victim into a son of Kyuss upon dropping to the ground.

Sons of Kyuss regenerate 2 hp per round; those reduced to 0 or fewer hp collapse as if dead but continue to regenerate and stand to resume fighting once they reach 1 hp. Fire, lightning, and holy water cause permanent damage, and the touch of holy water or a regeneration spell removes regeneration.

Hidden amid the tattered garments of the northern alcove is the mace +1, protection from negation (+1) he once employed.

Open Entryway -> Corridor (at chapel point)

### Archives

This chamber was designed to house books, scrolls, and records glorifying Khamsa and to provide detailed records of civil affairs as well as a god. Obviously, this room has not fared well through the ages. Khamsa held his god King of the Desert and glorified his name at the expense of all others, and his followers transcribed the evidence of this long ago. The room is now barren.

Double Doorway -> Corridor (at chapel point)

Inner Doors -> Trophy Room

### Trophy Room

The contents of this room are a testament to the power of Khamsa’s tower before his descent into madness. Piles of broken armor, shields, and other spoils of battle, all encased in a thick, greenish fungus, litter the room. Artifacts of dozens of Khamsa’s campaigns are preserved here; many are of great worth to the world’s collectors.

The entire collection can fetch up to 30,000 gp, but transporting the bulky objects across the desert is difficult at best. If used in combat, the weapons and shields shatter to fragments.

Of greater potential value to the PCs is a small ornamental scroll tube of an oddly purplish glass, hidden within a kilt of studded leather. This item will be discovered only if the adventurers sift through the room’s contents. The glass scroll within the tube is tattered and cracking, and is sealed with a soft, red wax ring. Written in faded script is a hurried warning regarding the Flail of the Desert Kings and the Circle of the Adder.

The nonmagical scroll, missed by Khamsa’s soldiers as they sorted through the booty belonging to a conquered foe, is an ancient letter written by a mage to his king on the eve of a war with Khamsa. If a comprehend languages spell is cast to decipher the archaic language, the PCs can extract the information given in the player’s handout above.

After reading the scroll, the PCs may determine that they should speak to a learned scholar before taking further action.The letter’s reference to the “hieroglyphs of the adder” concerns a raised glyph in area 12, “The Circle of the Adder.”

A bundle of banners and cloaks in the corner has grown its own fungus trap.

Yellow mold: INT non; AL nil; AC 9; MV 0; HD 0; hp 0; THAC0 16; #AT 1; Dmg 1–8; SA poison spores; SD affected only by fire; MR 20%; SZ S; MC2.

Any PC examining the pile is caught in the mold’s cloud of spores and must save vs. poison or die. Cure disease or raise dead spells must be cast within 24 hours to restore the victim.

Unlocked banded wood doors open outward to the gallery.

Banded Wood Doors -> Gallery

## Level Two

This was the primary level of the temple in Khamsa’s day, though the original entrance is now buried by sand. The bulk of the level consists of a vast chamber that climbs to well over 100’ in height.

### Balconies

Winding around the atrium are three levels of walkways, each 15’ wide. The inner edges feature ornate stone railings overlooking the center of the chamber below. A section of the second tier is broken away along the eastern wall, allowing the PCs to lower themselves with ropes to the first tier. Each tier has a set of 15’-wide stairs in the southwest corner leading down to the next level. The final tier ends at a set of stairs, along the western wall of the atrium, that descends to the atrium.

Levels 1-2 Stairway -> Corridor

Balcony-Atrium Stairway -> Atrium

### Atrium

The most prominent feature of this cavernous chamber is a set of huge statues of kneeling gods, a bas-relief 20’ high, each with a beastly head atop a human body, as appropriate for the deity depicted, with hieroglyphics identifying the figure. A cleric has a base 25% chance, plus 5% per level and 5% for every point of Wisdom over 15, for recognizing the pantheon. The pillar in the northeast corner, which once portrayed Set, is cracked and broken above the shoulders, leaving it indistinguishable.

The god, infuriated at being portrayed as a kneeling vassal, destroyed the statue’s head in a fit of rage. The rest of the column is intact.

Coiled about the statue of Set and hidden in the darkness is a monstrous cobra that attacks any PC within 10’. This ancient serpent’s poison is absolutely deadly; any PC bitten who fails a saving throw vs. poison dies without delay.

Balcony-Atrium Stairway -> Balconies

Rounded Grand Stairway -> Down to Khamsa’s Sanctuary (Level Three)

A long, matched set of circular stairs descends 40’ to the earth, to a chamber once used as Khamsa’s sanctuary.

#### Shrine

In the center of the semicircular, domed Atrium stands an empty 8’-high pedestal. At the pedestal is a circular depression designed to hold the base of a statue. Khamsa intended his image to be placed here, the servants of the divinities, like vassals, would bow to their heads in homage. Carved on the front of the pedestal is the following message:

“Behold me in my splendor, king of kings, feared by the gods and worshiped by man. I am Khamsa, master of all I survey.”

Inside the depression is a small, harmless-looking coiled grass snake, 1’ long and motionless.

Any PC attempting to examine the head of the flame snake breathes weapon and suffers 1d6 flame damage (save for half damage). The serpent and breathe flame up to five times before dying of exhaustion. The pedestal also unlocks.

## Level Three

The curving stairs meet at a small landing that accesses to a 20’ wide semicircular ramp covered by a tattered, stained carpet. A strange, marble stone light glows eerily from the base of the stairwell.

### Khamsa’s Sanctuary

This lavish, columned room was built to accommodate great lethargy, for the most distinctive feature is a plush divan and many soft, silken cushions, all set on a large raised platform at the rear of the chamber. This luxury is in stark contrast to the more repulsive inhabitant. The greater medusa Echidna sleeps on the platform, her serpentine hair running the length of the platform.

The medusa retains full mastery of her gaze attack, although she resorts to her bow when faced with extended fight, firing arrows poisoned with her own blood. 

When the PCs arrive, the medusa is fully awake and prepared to attack. She is beautiful but wholly alien and evil. She's also quite intelligent and leads her companions in an ambush. The medusa’s victims are typically those of Set’s minions, worm-filled weaklings who die quickly; without the gift of stone, the prospect of battling and defeating an armed adventuring party delights her.

For the moment, she is content to allow the party to stumble into her trap.

Concealed on the shadowy ceiling is a net of entrapment animated by the glyptar, who is tied to the strands along its weighted ends. The net glides along the ceiling in silence and drops on the party when it has its best advantage, triggering the remaining occupants’ attack. The trap drops in a 10’ square, and all within the area must save vs. spells or become snared. Up to four PCs can be bound without hope of escape until the command word “jipad” (“release”) is uttered. (A PC with a Strength of 20 can open the net.)

The rope of the net has AC –10 with respect to attacks, but damage done to the net does not harm the glyptar. Sawing can’t sever the ropes; they must be hacked apart, endangering PCs caught within. The glyptar itself is a dirty amethyst crystal approximately the size of a human fist and nearly indistinguishable from the other rock wings. Only the hidden close impositions impossible during combat will reveal that it is different from the others. One of the trapped PCs may notice this difference, however, if he makes an Intelligence check on 1d20 at a –10 penalty.

Once the net has dropped, the greater medusa — a filmy, diaphanous gown covering her repugnant torso — bursts through the curtain and attacks with bow and arrow. Echidna attacks with great malice. Believing herself immortal, she fights to the death, eager to destroy every PC and enjoy a greater feast for the coming 1,000 years.

Simultaneously, her maedar son emerges from his hiding place in the pillar marked with an X, attacking from behind and gaining automatic surprise on the first round of combat. The maedar attacks with his two powerful fists, attempting to disrupt spellcasting or subdue a powerful adventurer who is threatening the medusa.






If the medusa dies while the PCs possess the means to dispel magic the stone victims used against its effect, Echidna, the greater medusa reverts to her crystalline form. If her name is spoken aloud, she will reemerge magically, and any PC expecting her to perform at his command will be in for quite a shock, for she has a will of her own and instantly attacks her summoner.

Even if the party manages to slay Echidna, she is still deadly, for any PC touching her body must save vs. poison or die. If the medusa is slain before the dungeon, her maedar attempts to use his stone to flesh ability to restore her through one of the chamber walls. He remains there until the adventurers are dead, then sustains himself nearly as long as he lives, hoping to systemically regain new prey.

The net of entrapment can be emerged from if the PCs in it is not destroyed in the struggle with the glyptar, but the PCs must discover the command word.

If Echidna and her baby die that way, any petrified PC will be instantly slain unless the stone to flesh ability of the maedar who remains is still in effect.

A secret door, operated by a pressure plate in the narrow base of the divan, swings inward to reveal the temple treasury (see area 14).

Secret Treasury Door -> Treasury

#### Echidna the Greater Medusa (NPC)

This greater medusa is a special creation of the evil deity Set. The god bound her life essence to a statuette he employed to gain revenge on Khamsa, a boastful, blasphemous human king who dared to challenge the god’s authority. Once Echidna petrified the impudent mortal, Set allowed her to claim the king’s temple as her own and directed his minions to bring her tribute and a regular diet of victims. Although her statuette form resembles a figure of wondrous power, she cannot be controlled by anyone other than Set himself.

Echidna (greater medusa): INT very; AL LE; AC 3; MV 12; HD 8; hp 51; THAC0 13; #AT 1 plus weapon; Dmg 1–4; SA petrification, poison; SD poisonous blood; MR 20%; SZ M; ML 14; XP 4,000; MC1.

Because of her supernatural origin, the greater medusa has survived for thousands of years beyond the typical lifespan of her kind. These years have been spent in a state of almost constant slumber, with the beast waking only to feed. Her powers, and despite the fact that she sleeps, remain exceptionally keen. Like a spider in her web, she is alerted to the presence of a living humanoid within the temple and wakes in an instant. With a heart as cold as a gravestone, she exists only to destroy life and glorify Set.

The destruction of Echidna causes the temple to collapse, shaking the desert sands above and sealing the site for another age. PCs who escape in time will witness a column of dust and green flame rising into the night sky — a final sign of Set’s wrath.

Note: The imminent destruction of the temple will leave the PC's very little time to access the treasury.

### Treasury

This hidden chamber was designed to contain Khamsa’s most valuable treasures. Though looted by generations of desert wanderers, much still remains, for many of the treasures are trapped or cursed, and only the most cunning robbers have survived. The room measures roughly 40’ by 50’ and is lined with stone benches and three large chests. A narrow door on the north wall leads to a descending stairway (area 15).

Each of the chests is carved from black basalt and decorated with gold leaf symbols of serpents coiled around suns. They are sealed with heavy lids weighing nearly 200 pounds apiece.

The first chest contains a jumble of coins—nearly 2,500 sp, 1,200 gp, and 50 pp—but it is guarded by a scorpion swarm that bursts forth when the lid is disturbed.

Scorpions, giant (20): INT non; AL N; AC 3; MV 9; HD 2+2; hp 11 each; THAC0 19; #AT 3; Dmg 1-3/1-3/1-2; SA poison sting (save or die); SZ S; ML 10; XP 120 each; MC3.

The second chest contains a series of small leather pouches, each filled with rare gemstones, ivory jewelry, and gold anklets. Total value: 4,000 gp. The chest is trapped with a glyph of warding (blast of flame, 3d8 damage, save vs. spell for half).

The third chest contains the Circlet of the Adder, one of the legendary regalia of Khamsa himself. Crafted of black gold and adorned with twin serpent motifs, the circlet pulses faintly with a cold inner light.

Circlet of the Adder: When worn by a lawful or evil-aligned being, this artifact grants +2 AC protection and immunity to normal poisons. Once per day, the wearer can command the circlet to animate, transforming the serpents into living adders that attack a designated target (THAC0 15; Dmg 1d6 + poison; duration 5 rounds).
If worn by a good-aligned character, the circlet constricts like a living snake for 2d6 damage per round until removed (save vs. spell negates).

The circlet rests on a pillow of red silk beneath a thin coating of dust. A faint hiss can be heard when the lid is lifted, though the source is unseen.

Any PC lingering in the room more than two turns will hear the faint grinding of stone below — the first sign that the guardian in area 15 has been awakened.

Secret Treasury Door  -> Khamsa's Sanctuary

#### Item: Flail of the Desert Kings

A +3 weapon; grants wielder immunity to all heat-based attacks and allows animate dead once per day. However, each use of its necromantic power permanently drains 1 point of Constitution from a non-evil wielder. Evil wielders suffer no penalty but are subject to the will of Set (50% chance of possession each use).
